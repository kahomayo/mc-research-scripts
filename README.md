# Minecraft Research Tools

This repo contains a bunch of research tools for messing with minecraft. I am hosting it publically, so that others can benefit from the research. This is just me messing around, do not rely on me keeping it maintained.

Also, the code quality is real bottom-of-the-barrell stuff in places, cuz I'm just trying to throw some script together.
